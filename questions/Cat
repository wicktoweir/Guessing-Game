First clue: I can see about 6 times better than a human at night.
People that love me dearly are known as "ailurophiles"
I sleep a large portion of the day, on average, 16 hours!
I used to be thought of as color blind, but now it is suspected I can actually see blues, greens and maybe even reds.
I have 2 vocal chords and can make over 100 sounds.
