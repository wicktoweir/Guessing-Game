First clue: I am usually nocturnal.
My eyes are fixed in my sockets, so I typically have to move my whole head to see in a different direction.
I am equipped with special feathers that limit the amount of noise I make while moving.
I am carnivorous.
I often hunt and eat things with fur and bones, which I cannot digest, so I expel them in something known as a pellet.
