First clue: I am crepuscular, which means I am active during dusk and dawn.
Many think I am a rodent, but I am actually in a family called lagomorphs.
I love vegetables, but few know that I have a sweet tooth and love bananas.
I may be cute and cuddly, but I don't like to be held.
If I am a female, I can produce up to 10 babies every 31 days.
